'''
what connected components are, their uses, and how to implement them with code. 

- Disjoint graph -> Groups of nodes on a graph that are connected to each other 
- The entire cluster
- Who uses them? -> social networks (friends), actual computer networks (devices), epidemics (how it's spreading)

How to find them using BFS

- Loop through each available node
- Has it been explored?
- Once search terminates, increase counter to 1


Strongly connected components
- Ways that they are connected
- Has to do with nodes within a group being able to get to any other node within the group
